This is one of my early works in Processing. It was inspired by the great Piet Mondrian, a Dutch painter in the early 1900s. The central theme of his art consist of white background, grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and three primary colors. I replicated his famous painting, "Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow", using software mirror technique created with a video object in Processing. My sister and I are waving at you in the video. Hi!
